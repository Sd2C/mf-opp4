/**
 * @brief Keeps track of the different snir levels when receiving a
 * packet
 *
 * This module keeps track of the noise level of the channel.
 *
 * When receiving a packet this module updates the noise level of the
 * channel. Based on the receive power of the packet it is processed
 * and handed to upper layers or just treated as noise.
 *
 * After the packet is completely received the snir information is
 * attached and it is handed to the deceider module. The snir 
 * information may be manipulated if the module received the 
 * frame before the radio was in received mode. 
 * The snir information is a SnrList that lists all different snr
 * levels together with the point of time starting from which the radio 
 * is switched in the received mode. 
 *
 * On top of that this module subscribs the RadioState on the
 * Blackboard. The radio state gives information about whether this
 * module is sending a packet, receiving a packet or idle. This
 * information can be accessed via the Blackboard by other modules,
 * e.g. a CSMAMacLayer.
