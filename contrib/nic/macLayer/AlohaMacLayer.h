/**
 * @class AlohaMacLayer
 * @brief MAC module which provides pure Aloha
 *
 * This is an implementation of a pure Aloha (not slottes). The idea
 * of Aloha is to send a packet whenever a packet is ready to be sent.
 *
 * If a packet from the upper layer arrives although there is still
 * another packet waiting for its transmission or being transmitted
 * the new packet is stored in a queue. The length of this queue can
 * be specified by the user in the omnetpp.ini file. By default the
 * length is 10. The minimum queue length is 1. If the queue is full
 * new packet(s) will be deleted.
