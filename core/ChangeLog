	* general: reduced core to real core functionality of the mf; everything
	above the decider is now in contrib; core reduced to abstract classes, all
	concrete realisations are now in contrib
	* BasicModule.*: moved to basicModules
	* basicNetworks: moved to networks

2005-01-18  ------ mobility-fw1_0a5 released ------

2004-11-22  ------ mobility-fw1.0a4 released ------

2004-11-05  ------ mobility-fw1.0a4 released ------

2004-11-02	Marc Löbbers
	* BasicModule.cc: added (std::ostream&) to debug line so that it also
	compiles with VC7
	
2004-10-20  ------ mobility-fw1.0a3 released ------

2004-10-04	Daniel Willkomm
	* makefrag: deleted networkLinks target (not needed for omnet++3.0a7
	or higher).

2004-09-28	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicModule: added getLogName(int id) function to return the 
	logName of the module with id

2004-09-24	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicModule.cc: introduced logName() to return the ned module
	name of the host that can be used for logging output.
	deleted hostIndex() as it can be ambigous using multiple kinds of
	hosts.
	introduced new logging according to Andras proposal on omnetpp.org.

2004-09-19	Daniel Willkomm 
	* BasicModule.cc: changed strcmp() in findHost to strstr(). The
	ned HostModule name is now only required to contain the pattern
	"host" or "Host" somewhere in the name and not to match the whole 
	pattern	anymore. This enables the definition of diffeent host types 
	(like	base station and clients).

2004-09-13	Daniel Willkomm
	* Makefile.vc: updated windows Makefile to reflect the changes
	in mkmk.cmd.

2004-08-18  ------ mobility-fw1.0a2 released ------

2004-08-16	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicModule.h: moved from basicModules to here. BasicModule is
	needed by basicModules and channelControl files and -I. is not
	really working with opp_makemake
	* BasicModules.cc: moved from basicModules to here

	* makefrag: added the generatedheaders dependency so that messages
	theoretical don't need to be in a seperate directory anymore
