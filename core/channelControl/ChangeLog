	* NicEntry.h: removed 'NicEntry::' from getOutGateTo function

	* all: updated doxygen groups

2006-06-08:	Daniel Willkomm
	* ChannelControl.*: updated docu: path loss alpha, sat, pMax... are to 
	compute the MAXIMUM interference distance and can be changed in SnrEval,
	but never such that the max interf. distance becomes bigger. Made 
	speedOfLight a const var.

2006-06-07:	Daniel Willkomm
	* all files: clean up debuging: moved debug includes and ChannelControl 
	includes to the .cc files

2005-11-23: Daniel Willkomm
	* NicEntry.h: is derieved from cPolymorphic now

2005-11-01:	Daniel Willkomm
	* NicEntry*: Cleanup and restructuring; Moved a lot of functionality into 
	NicEntry.h; NicEntryDebug and NicEntryDirect only implement the absolutely 
	necessary differences; implemented getOutGateTo for both - not tested with 
	P2PPhy yet
	* ChannelControl.cc, ChannelAccess.cc: adjusted to new NicEntry behaviour

2005-10-21: Daniel Willkomm
	* NicEntry*: added getOutGateTo function to support P2PPhy, not complete yet
	for NicEntryDirect
	* ChannelControl.*: added getOutGateTo function to support P2PPhy

2005-10-21: Daniel Willkomm
	* NicEntry*: added nicEV for debugging messages within NicEntry*; NicEntry
	reads the coreDebug variable from ChannelControl
	* CHannelAccess.cc: changed sendToChannel useSendDirect loop. Now it is also
	possible for a host to have multiple nics

2005-10-20: Daniel Willkomm
	* ChannelControl.*: adapted to support sendDirect, simplified
	updateConnections
	* NicEntry.h: Added some more variables and functions from NicEntryDebug as
	they are needed for NicEntryDirect as well
	* NicEntryDebug.*: adapted to coexist with NicEntryDirect, simplified gate
	management with ChannelAccess
	* NicEntryDirect.*: Implemented the possibility to use sendDirect
	* ChannelAccess.*: Added support for sendDirect, removed registerNewOutGate 

2005-10-20: Andreas Koepke
	* ChannelControl.*: changed ChannelControl to grid system

2005-10-18: Daniel Willkomm
	* NicEntryDebug.h: added constructor and destructor

2005-10-18: Daniel Willkomm
	* ChannelAccess.*: adapted to new Blackboard
	* ChannelControl.*: NicEntry is an own class now (in an own file),
	generalized ChannelControl so that it can support sendDirect and sending
	through gates
	* NicEntry.h: added abstract class NicEntry
	* NicEntryDebug.*: added NicEntry class to use gates for visualisation of
	connections

2004-09-24	Daniel Willkomm
	* ChannelAccess.cc: introduced new logging according to Andras 
	proposal on omnetpp.org, logName is used instead of hostIndex().
	* ChannelControl.cc: introduced new logging according to Andras
  proposal on omnetpp.org.
	removed obsolte host2netw mapping stuff, as network module id()
	is used as a appl address now.
	* ChannelControl.ned: added coreDebug parameter.

2004-09-19	Daniel Willkomm
	* ChannelAccess.h: sendToChannel uses the	OMNeT++ 
	sendDelayed() function	instead of send() to be able to 
	send messages with a delay. If no delay is desired use
	0.0.
