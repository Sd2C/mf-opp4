/**
 * In protocol simulations, one often has to evaluate the performance
 * of a protocol. This implies that not only the protocol has to be
 * developed, but also the code used for the performance evaluation.
 * Often, this leads to ugly implementations: real protocol code is
 * mixed with debug and performance evaluation code. This mix becomes
 * annoying if the code is made public to the community.
 *
 * Another, somewhat similar, problem appears if programmers want to
 * implement new protocols that integrate information from other
 * protocol layers. Usually, researchers have to reimplement at least
 * parts of the protocol tp expose the necessary information -- making
 * it less useful for other researchers as this usually increases the
 * coupling of the protocols.
 *
 * One way around both problems is a black board. On the black board,
 * protocols publish their state and possible state changes. It is now
 * possible to separate performance monitors from the protocol
 * code. Also, cross-layer information exchange also boils down to
 * publishing and subscribing information -- without introducing tight
 * coupling. The only commonly known entity is the blackboard.
 *
 * The interaction with the blackboard is simple:
 *
 * publisher -publish(BBItem)-> Blackboard -notify(BBItem)--> subscriber
 *
 * The publisher can be anything that knows how to call a Blackboard
 * and how to construct a proper BBItem. It remains the logical owner
 * of the published item. The BB neither stores it, nor keeps any
 * reference to it.
 *
 * The subscriber must implement the ImNotifiable
 * interface. It can keep a copy of the published item (cache it), but
 * it should not keep a reference to it. Otherwise, things become
 * really messy. (Some code written for older versions of the BB
 * speaks for itself).
