	* Blackboard reduced, new basis is the notification board of
	Andras Varga. Simplified publish and subscribe, cleared up
	ownership of published item. 

	* BBItem reduced -- this class is the basis to enable category
	enumeration. It is now possible to sub class a published item. The
	subscribers of the parent class still get informed.

	* BBItemRef replaced by integers -- these integers describe the
	category of the published item. Users can now work with
	static_cast

	* PositionUpdate introduced -- BBItem that is needed for mobility
