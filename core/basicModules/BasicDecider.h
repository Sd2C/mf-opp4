/**
 * @brief Module to decide whether a frame is received correctly or is
 * lost due to bit errors, interference...
 *
 * The decider module only handles messages from lower layers. All
 * messages from upper layers are directly passed to the snrEval layer
 * and cannot be processed in the decider module
 *
 * This is the basic decider module which does not really decide
 * anything. It only provides the basic functionality which all
 * decider modules should have, namely message de- & encapsulation
 * (For further information about the functionality of the physical
 * layer modules and the formats used for communication in between
 * them have a look at "The Design of a Mobility Framework in OMNeT++"
 * paper)
 *
 * Every own decider module class should be derived from this class
 * and only the handle*Msg functions may be redefined for your own
 * needs. The other functions should usually NOT be changed.
 *
 * All decider modules should assume bits as a unit for the length
 * fields.
