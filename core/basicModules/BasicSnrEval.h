/**
 * @brief The basic class for all snrEval modules
 *
 * The BasicSnrEval module provides functionality like en- and
 * decapsulation of messages. If you use the standard message formats
 * everythng should work fine. Before a packet is sent some
 * information, e.g. transmission power, can be written to the
 * AirFrame header. If you write your own snrEval, just subclass and
 * redefine the handleUpperMsg function (see description of the
 * function). After receiving a message it can be processed in
 * handleLowerMsgStart. Then it is buffered for the time the
 * transmission would last in reality, and then can be handled
 * again. Again you can redefine the 1. handleLowerMsgStart and
 * 2. handleLowerMsgEnd for your own needs (see description). So, the
 * call of these functions represent the following events: 1. received
 * a message (i.e. transmission startet) 2. message will be handed on
 * to the upper layer (i.e. transmission time is over)
