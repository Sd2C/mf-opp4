	* all: updated doxygen groups

2006-07-05:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicMacLayer.cc: delete the MacPkt in decapsMsg; removed the delete from
	handleLowerMsg

2006-07-04:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.cc: changed cc->sensitivity back to cc->sat; sensitivity is
	converted to mW and not saved as dBm anymore

2006-06-26:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicMobility.cc: moved getRandomPosition() to initialization stage 1
	to ensure correct playground size from cc (which is set in stage 0

2006-06-22:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicMobility.*: Complete reimplementation of the border handling. The host
	now actaully moves to the border and then takes the action as specified by the
	BorderPolicy. Supports atomic and non atomic movements.

2006-06-14:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicMobility.*: added updateInterval parameter and makeMove function. 
	BasicMobility now is a slim version of LineSegmentsBase and thus a base
	for almost all mobility modules

2006-06-08:	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.*: read standard values for sat, path loss, transmissionPower
	and carrierFrequency from ChannelControl. Check for correct values for these
	parameters in stage 1 of initialization. moved scheduling of txOverTimer to
	sendDown.
	* BasicMacLayer.*: moved from contrib (former SimpleMacLayer). made abstact
	just provides de and encapsulation and lower layer message handling
	* BasicDecider.*: made abstract, added decapsMsg convienience function

2006-06-07	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.cc: removed TransmComplete message

2005-10-21: Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.cc: copy kind and name from mac message for
	  visibility in tkenv

2005-10-20: Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.ned: added radioIn gate for sendDirect

2005-10-18: Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicModule.h: adapted blackboard functions to new Blackboard
	* BasicMobility.*: added border policy functionalities, adapted to new
	Blackboard

2005-10-18: Daniel Willkomm
	* Basic*: moved BasicAppplLayer.* BasicNetwLayer.* BasicNic.ned
	BasicMacLayer.* P2P* TestApplLayer.* to contrib
	+ BasicModule.*: moved here from ..

2005-01-18  ------ mobility-fw1_0a5 released ------

2004-11-22  ------ mobility-fw1.0a4 released ------

2004-11-05  ------ mobility-fw1.0a4 released ------

2004-11-04	Marc Löbbers
	* P2PPhyLayer.cc: Chose RNG nr 0 in the bernoulli() function
	as there is only one RNG by default in the new RNG architecture
	
2004-11-04	Marc Löbbers 
	* BasicMobility.cc: changed getRandomPosition(). 
	Now RNG number 0 is always used because there is only
	one RNG by default in the new RNG architecture (OMNeT 3.0a9)
	
2004-11-02	Marc Löbbers
	* Basic*.cc: added (std::ostream&) to debug line so that it also
	compiles with VC7
	
2004-10-20  ------ mobility-fw1.0a3 released ------

2004-09-28	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicApplLayer.ned: changed debug parameter to bool

2004-09-24	Daniel Willkomm
	* Basic*.cc: introduced getSenderName() to return the logName of the
	sender of a message for easy TKEnv debugging.
	* all cc files: introduced new logging according to Andras proposal on
	omnetpp.org, logName is used instead of hostIndex().
	* *.ned: added coreDebug parameter to all modules.
	* P2PPhyLayer.cc: added calcDuration() function like it is already 
	present	in BasicSnrEval.

2004-09-23	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicNetwLayer.cc: changed application layer address: It is now
	the same as the network layer address again. The host module
	index() does not work if we want to allow multiple host
	types. getNetwAddr( int ) is deleted from the module.
	* BasicApplLayer.h: introduced myApplAddr() which returns the
	network module id().
	* TestApplLayer.cc: addapted the TestApplLayer to the new address
	handling.

2004-09-22	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicNetwLayer.cc: deleted numHost parameter as it is not needed
	for the BasicModule and may not be present in all simulations.

2004-09-19	Daniel Willkomm
	* *::sendDelayedUp/Down: Introduced sendDelayedUp and
	sendDelayedDown for all Basic*Modules, in order to be able to send
	messages with a delay (suggested by Horacio Sanson). sendUp &
	sendDown are still there for convienience.
	* TestApplLayer.cc: modified to use to newly introduced
	sendDelayedDown function instead of a self message to simulate the
	processing delay.

2004-09-16	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicSnrEval.cc: bugfix: encapsMsg, calcDuration(frame) instead
	of calcDuration(msg).

2004-08-18  ------ mobility-fw1.0a2 released ------

2004-08-17	Daniel Willkomm
	* BasicModule.h: moved to core dir
	* BasicModule.cc: moved to core dir

2004-07-23  ------ mobility-fw1.0a1 released ------
