      <h2>OMNeT++ Coding Conventions / Style Guide</h2>
      <b>(last updated: Sept 17 1999)</b>

      <p>
	Here's a bunch of advice on how to write OMNeT++ models. Some
	of them are "rules of thumb", saying if you program like that,
	you're likely to have less trouble; other conventions are
	aimed at making OMNeT++ models higher quality and more
	consistent.

      <h3>Source files</h3>

      <p>
	1. Put the NED description, the C++ class declaration and the
	implementation of a simple module into three separate
	files. Don't put two or more modules' code into the same file
	unless they are build upon one another - do not be afraid of
	small files! Thus, for a simple module called Foobar, you
	should have Foobar.ned, Foobar.h and Foobar.cc. This reduces
	coupling of module sources and makes your code more reusable.

      <h3>C++ coding style</h3>

      <p>
	2. Write legible C++ code. Choose your favourite indentation
	style and keep to it consistently. (I would prefer the style
	in which the OMNeT++ sources are written.) Don't put more than
	one statement on the same line. Always use blank lines to
	break the code into not-very-long logical blocks; above each
	block, put a comment of few-words what that block does. Always
	put at least two blank lines between two (member)
	functions. Remember: the structure of your code should be
	obvious at the first glance!

      <p>
	3. Identifiers: Begin module type names with a capital letter,
	and capitalize the beginning of each word, like in
	TokenRingMAC. Do not use underscore `_` in module names. Use
	the C++-style naming on member functions: beginning of each
	word is capitalized (except for the first one) and no
	underscores: sendUnnumberedFrame(). On parameter names, use
	C++-style naming, e.g. windowSize.

      <h3>Organizing simple modules</h3>

      <p>
	4. Put state variables into the class declaration as data
	members instead of local variables to activity(). This enables
	referencing them in finish() as well as splitting up
	activity().

      <p>
	5. Objects like cQueues, cOutVectors, cStdDevs also go into
	the class declaration. You can assign names to them with
	setName() and otherwise initialize them at the top of the
	activity() function. This way you can avoid having to write
	the simple module constructor explicitly.

      <p>
	6. Avoid global variables (and what's the same, static class
	members). They are not reset to their initial value (zero)
	when you run the simulation, stop it and rebuild the
	network. This can cause several problems when you use Cmdenv
	to execute several runs one after another, or in Tkenv when
	you rebuild the network from the menu.

      <p>
	7. Query the values of parameters into state variables
	(--&gt;class members) of the same name at the top of the
	activity() function. If you know the value of a parameter is a
	random value (like uniform 0..10) or it can change during
	simulation, then to avoid having to look it up by name each
	time (like d=par("delay")) you may query its pointer into a
	cPar* state variable with the same name prepended with 'p'
	(like pDelay=&amp;par("delay")).

      <h3>Constructors, destructors, initialize() and finish()</h3>

      <p>
	8. Never put code that's supposed to do simulation-related
	things into the simple module destructor; put them into
	finish() instead. In fact, you almost never need to write a
	destructor since OMNeT++ keeps track of objects you create
	(dynamically, as local variables or as class members) and
	disposes of them automatically. However it cannot track
	non-OMNeT++ objects so they may need to be deleted manually
	from the destructor.

      <p>
	9. You need to write the simple module constructor exlicitly
	if you have dynamic data structures in the class that need to
	be freed by the destructor. Even in this case, make the
	constructor as simple as possible (e.g. simply NULL out the
	data structure pointers) and leave real work to the activity()
	function.

      <p>
	10.Especially, do not put simulation-related code into the
	simple module constructor. For example, modules often need to
	investigate their surroundings (maybe the whole network) at
	the beginning of the simulation and save the collected info
	into internal tables. Code like that cannot be placed into the
	constructor since the network is still being set up when the
	constructor is called.

      <h3>Make use of what C++ offers</h3>

      <p>
	11.Do not hesitate to split up the activity() function to
	several member functions, as this generally improves code
	readability. For example, if you're implementing a state
	machine, you can put the general logic into activity() and the
	code implementing the actual states into separate member
	functions. As a rule of thumb, one member function shouldn't
	be more than one screen page (about 25 lines) unless really
	necessary.

      <p>
	12.Make the functions virtual. Maybe someone who reuses your
	code will need a different behavior than what you thought of.

      <p>
	13.Use inheritance if you're writing a very complex simple
	module: create a basic simple module class and build upon it
	deriving new module classes. This will make your code more
	readable and easier to manage/reuse. Unfortunately,
	inheritance is not supported in NED so you actually have to
	make distinct NED descriptions for each simple module
	class. Even if you have an abstract classes, prepare a NED
	desctiption for it: it is useful as a reference to others who
	might derive a different simple module class from your
	abstract class. Inheritance in NED is planned in later
	releases of OMNeT++.
	
      <h3>For better performance</h3>

      <p>
	14.Consider using subclassing cMessage to add parameters to it
	instead of using cPar parameters. Simulations using message
	subclassing are reported to have 5..10 times (!) performance
	advantage to those using cPar message parameters.

      <p>
	15.Reuse messages wherever possible, as this can result in a
	tremendous gain in execution speed! For example, if you
	implement timers, you can create a message once and then
	schedule the same message again and again each time the timer
	is restarted. Look at the Fifo example about how to do it.

      <h3>Prepare for debugging</h3>

      <p>
	16.Use ev.printf() and ev&lt;&lt;... generously to print out
	information on what the module is doing. Doing so will pay out
	several times when it comes to debugging. Use a parameter and
	a state variable called debug. Surround your debugging output
	(ev&lt;&lt;... and ev.printf() calls) with if(debug). You may
	introduce more specific debug switches (like debug_queuing
	etc.)

      <p>
	17.Put a WATCH() on the state variables (including debug) at
	the top of the activity function. They cause no run-time
	overhead, consume little memory and can be invaluable during
	debugging.
