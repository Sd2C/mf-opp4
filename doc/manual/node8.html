7.1 The Mobility Architecture
</H2>

<P>
This section describes the mobility architecture used in the MF. First
the general concept is described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:cc">7.2</A>.
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:mobility">7.3</A> describes how to create won mobility
modules.

<P>
There are two mayor questions to consider for a mobility architecture
in a simulation framework. The first question is where to process
mobility information and and how to handle the movements of
<I>Hosts</I>. Where and how to dynamically handle connections in an
efficient way is the second decision to make.

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
We decided to handle mobility in a distributed manner locally in every
<I>Host</I> module. Decisions how and where to move neither affect
other <I>Hosts</I> nor do they require global knowledge. Connection
management is handled centrally by one central controller. In order to
set up and tear down connections the distances between <I>Hosts</I>
have to be calculated for which we need the global knowledge of the
position of all <I>Hosts</I>.

<P>
The core component of our mobility architecture is the global
<I>ChannelControl</I> module together with an independent
<I>MobilityModule</I> in each <I>Host</I> module
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:arch">5</A>). <I>ChannelControl</I> handles all connection
related things whereas the <I>MobilityModules</I> have two main tasks:
The first task is to handle the movements of the <I>Host</I>. This can
be done using various different mobility models (such as Manhattan
Mobility or Brownian Motion). Second the <I>MobilityModule</I>
communicates the location changes of the <I>Host</I> to the
<I>ChannelControl</I> module. <I>ChannelControl</I> then updates all
connection for this <I>Host</I>. The functionality of the
<I>MobilityModules</I> is further described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:mobility">7.3</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00082000000000000000"></A>

7.2 ChannelControl
</H2>
The <I>ChannelControl</I> module is responsible for establishing
communication channels between <I>Host</I> modules that are within
communication distance and tearing down these connections once they
loose connectivity again. The loss of connectivity can be due to
mobility (i.e. the <I>Hosts</I> move too far apart) or due to a
change in transmission power or a crashed <I>Host</I> etc. We decided
to keep the concept of links between <I>Host</I> modules, as opposed
to direct message passing, since visible communication paths are an
important source of (debugging) information in early development
stages.

<P>
Unfortunately, in OMNeT++ distinct links between modules require at
least two gate objects for each module, one in- and one out- gate (and
for each submodule as well). For our MF the minimal number of
gates per link is six since the <I>Nic</I> module is embedded
within the <I>Host</I> module and is itself subdivided into an
<I>SnrEval</I>, a <I>Decider</I> module and a <I>Mac</I> module. (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#sec:nic">4.3</A>). To make sure to have enough gates even in the
worst case scenario (all <I>Hosts</I> are directly connected), each
<I>Host</I> module needs at least two pairs of gates for every single
<I>Host</I> module in the network.  Assuming <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$ n$"> <I>Hosts</I> in the
network one <I>Host</I> would need <IMG
 WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="$ 6(n-1)$"> gates or <IMG
 WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="$ 3(n-1)$"> gate
pairs, leading to <!-- MATH
 $6n(n-1)\approx 6n^2$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$ 6n(n-1)\approx 6n^2$"> gates in the whole network.

<P>
A more memory-efficient approach is to create gates dynamically which
is the way we decided to go. Gates are not allocated in bulk upon
initialization of the network but created dynamically upon demand.
Each <I>Host</I> module maintains two lists one for the free in-gates
and one for the free out-gates. Once <I>ChannelControl</I> wants to
establish a link between two <I>Hosts</I>, it first checks the gate
lists in both <I>Hosts</I> whether free gates are available and only
if no free gate was found a new one is created. Upon link break
<I>ChannelControl</I> tears down the connection and adds the newly
freed gates to the corresponding gate list. With this approach we
minimize the memory needed without increasing the computational
overhead to create and destroy gates too much.

<P>
In wireless network simulations not only the fact whether two hosts
are connected (i.e. can communicate with each other) is important but
also the fact whether two hosts can interfere with each other. That is
why the term <I>connection</I> gets a slightly different meaning
for our MF. Upon initialization, the <I>ChannelControl</I>
module determines the maximum interference distance based on global
network parameters such as the carrier frequency of the channel, the
maximal possible sending power and other propagation specific
parameters. The maximal interference distance is a conservative bound
on the maximal distance at which a <I>Host</I> can still possibly
disturb the communication of a neighbor, i.e. all <I>Hosts</I>
further away will not recognize the sending signal at all. Please note
that the maximal interference distance does neither specify the
maximal distance at which messages can be (correctly) received nor
does it specify the range at which <I>Hosts</I> definitely can receive
some signal (even if it is only noise). Single <I>Hosts</I> in the
network may have sending powers that are much less the maximum power
specified and thus cannot reach a <I>Host</I> they are (theoretically)
connected to. The maximum interference distance is just a theoretical
means of reducing the computational overhead of our MF.

<P>
Based on the maximal interference distance <I>ChannelControl</I>
calculates the connections between all <I>Hosts</I> upon
initialization of the network and updates the connections every time a
<I>Host</I> moves. Updating connections between <I>Hosts</I> is a
computationally expensive operation. Calculating the distance between
every pair of <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$ n$"> <I>Hosts</I> in a network has a complexity of
<!-- MATH
 $\mathrm{O}(n ^{2})$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="$ \mathrm{O}(n ^{2})$">. While this approach may not be
the most efficient way to go, it is sufficient for the current version
of our MF but could also be enhanced in case we experience
performance problems.

7.3 Implementing Mobility Models
</H2>

<P>
There is also the possibility to implement new mobility models. To do
so, you have to derive the class for your new mobility module from
<I>BasicMobility</I>. <I>BasicMobility</I> provides the
<I>getRandomPosition()</I> function which selects a random starting
position if no position is specified in the <I>omnetpp.ini</I> file.
If you want to use another way of getting a staring position you can
redefine this function.

<P>
Apart from that you have to do the following: At the times you want
your host to move you have to send yourself a self-message and
redefine the <I>handleSelfMsg()</I> function in which a new position
should be determined. The position has to be of the type Coord (see
API reference). As a final action in this function the
<I>updatePosition()</I> function has to be called. It automatically
updates the animated OMNeT++ GUI and furthermore writes the new
position to the <I>Blackboard</I>. For further details take a look at
the API reference of <I>BasicMobility</I>. As an example mobility
implementation you can also have a look at the
<I>ConstSpeedMobility</I> module in the <I>protocols/mobility</I>
folder.
