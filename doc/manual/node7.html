6 Using the Blackboard
</H1>

<P>
When you evaluate the performance of a protocol, you need information
on internal state changes of your protocol, maybe even from protocols
that you use. You could monitor these changes using e.g. vector files
from within you protocol and remove these monitors once you are done.
Another way is to use a blackboard. The state changes are published on
it, and the monitors subscribe to these values. This allows other
researchers to tap your protocol for performance evaluation, while
imposing nearly no runtime penalty when the information is not
needed. 

<P>
Maybe even more importantly, the blackboard allows you to exchange
information between layers, without passing pointers to the modules
around. Some items might not only be interesting for the layer they
are created/changed in. The physical layer for example (<I>snrEval</I>
in the MF) can sense whether a channel is busy or not. If the MAC
protocol is based on carrier sense it needs the information the
physical layer has. The <I>Blackboard</I> is a module where the
corresponding information can be published and then is accessible for
any module interested in it. 

<P>
The <I>BasicModule</I> provides everything necessary to interact with
the blackboard. It is derived from <I>ImNotifiable</I> - a pure
virtual base class that allows the blackboard to inform your module of
changes - and contains a pointer named <I>bb</I> to the blackboard
module.

6.1 Methods for the subscriber

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00071010000000000000">
6.1.0.1 Subscribing to a parameter</A>
</H4>
If you want to subscribe to a parameter, the best place to do so is
the initialize function in stage 0. Suppose for example that you want
to subscribe to changes of an item of the class <I>SomeBBItem</I>.
When this item is changed, you have to be able to interpret its
contents - and the way you can be sure that you can interpret the
data is to know its type (or class in C++). Such items can be signal
strength indicators, active radio channels, routing table entries,
reasons why packets where lost and so forth, we will talk more about
it in a separate section. 

<P>
<PRE>
void YourClass::initialize(int stage) {
    BaseClass::initialize(stage);
    if (stage == 0){
        SomeBBItem item;
        catItem = bb-&gt;subscribe(this, &amp;item, -1);
        ...
    } 
    else if(stage == 1) {
   ...
</PRE>

<P>
In case you want to subscribe to a parameter, i.e. you want to be
informed each time the content/value of that parameter changes, you
have to call the <I>Blackboard</I> function <I>subscribe()</I>. You
have to include a pointer to your module, a pointer to an object of
class <I>SomeBBItem</I>, and a scope. This function returns an integer
that is unique for the class <I>SomeBBItem</I>. The
section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:inform">6.2</A> shows how to use this parameter. The
Blackboard uses the <I>this</I> pointer to notify the module of
published changes. The object pointer <I>&amp; item</I> helps the
<I>Blackboard</I> to learn something about the changes that you are
subscribing. The <I>Blackboard</I> uses it to establish the connection
between the <I>catItem</I> and the <I>&amp;item</I>. The last parameter
of the function determines a scope, it needs a more detailed
explanation. A change can be published by several modules within a
host. Consider the RSSI and a host with more than one network card.
Each of these cards will publish a separate RSSI - but it will be of
the same class and can hence not be distinguished. However, the
meaning of the RSSI is constrained to one card (its scope): it makes
no sense for a MAC protocol of one card to take the RSSI of the other
card into consideration. The solution is to include the scope into the
publication and let the <I>Blackboard</I> do some filtering. In the
example code the subscriber uses -1 as the scope - a wildcard that
subscribes him to all changes published by any module. If you want to
subscribe to some specific stuff, you must make sure that the scope
(for network cards usually the module id of the card) under which the
parameter is published, matches the subscribed scope.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00071020000000000000">
6.1.0.2 Un-subscribing from a parameter</A>
</H4>
Sometimes parameter changes make only sometimes sense. For example,
the host may decide to go to sleep. In this case it may be reasonable
to unsubscribe: 
<PRE>
bb-&gt;unsubscribe(this, catItem);
</PRE>
Your module will not get notifications for this parameter anymore. 

<P>

<A NAME="sec:inform"></A>
<BR>
6.2 Getting informed
</H2>
Let us assume that you subscribed to a value and there is a valid
publisher. The publisher informs the Blackboard of a change, which in
turn calls the <I>receiveBBItem</I> method that your class inherited
from the abstract <I>ImNotifiable</I> base class. 

<P>
<PRE>
void YourClass::receiveBBItem(int category, \ 
const BBItem *details, int scopeModuleId) {
  // in case you want to handle messages here
  Enter_Method_Silent(); 
  // in case not you but your base class subscribed: 
  BaseClass::receiveBBItem(category, details, scopeModuleId);
  // react on the stuff that you subscribed
  if(category == catItem) {
      someBBItemPtr = 
           static_cast&lt;const SomeBBItem *&gt;(details);
      // do something 
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
The parameters of this function have already been explained in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:subscriber">6.1</A>. The first is the category, the integer
that the subscribe function returned, the second is a pointer to an
object of the class that you subscribed to and the third is the scope
of this parameter. You should place the <I>Enter_Method</I> or
<I>Enter_Method_Silent</I> macros at the beginning. This allows you to
schedule or cancel messages, besides doing some animation. You should
also inform the base class.  This pattern is probably familiar from
the initialize function. Now your base class will be informed about
all changes it subscribed (and some of them are not interesting to
<I>YourClass</I>) and the changes that <I>YourClass</I> subscribed.
This has two implications: if you forget this line, the simulation may
stop completely or behave strange. Secondly, <I>YourClass</I> must
gracefully handle any items that it did not subscribe. To support you
in that task, the item that you receive from the Blackboard is
read-only. 

<P>
In the next step, the published item is handled. It is easy to
determine its type: just check (may be in a switch statement) the
category and cast it to the right class. Since the association between
a class and its category is fixed, a static cast is safe and fast.
Now <I>YourClass</I> can interpret the content and do something about
it.

6.3 Methods for the publisher

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00073010000000000000">
6.3.0.1 Parameter</A>
</H4>
You can only publish objects, since in C++ classes carry the semantic
meaning. An integer can be used for everything: counting missed
lunches, counting stars, or packets. If you would subscribe to an
integer - how can your class know how to interpret it? This is where
classes help you:

<P>
<PRE>
class  MissedLunches : public BBItem {
    BBITEM_METAINFO(BBItem);
protected:
    int counter;
public:
    double getMissedLunches () const {
        return counter;
    }
    void setMissedLunches(int c) {
        counter = c;
    }
    void addMissedLunch() {
       counter++;
    }

    MissedLunches(int c=0) : BBItem(), counter(c) {
       // constructor
    };
    std::string info() const { // for inspection
        std::ostringstream ost;
        ost &lt;&lt; " You missed  " &lt;&lt; counter &lt;&lt; " lunches.";
        return ost.str();
    }
};
</PRE>
This associates the meaning ``missed lunch'' with an integer. At
least, this is how most humans would interpret the name of the class.
The class is derived directly from BBItem (which is derived from
cPolymorphic), the base class for all items that can be published on
the blackboard.

<P>
For advanced users: Of course it could also refine a class (say
MissedMeals) and have a different parent class. The call to
<code> BBITEM_METAINFO(BBItem);</code> helps the Blackboard to track the
inheritance tree. If MissedLunches would have been derived from
MissedMeals this should read <code>BBITEM_METAINFO(MissedMeals);</code>.
This trick allows the Blackboard to deliver MissedLunches to all
subscribers of MissedMeals.

<P>
After this you simply go ahead with a standard C++ class definition,
and do what you like. The info function is optional, but helpful with
debugging.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00073020000000000000">
6.3.0.2 Publishing</A>
</H4>
Ok, now that the parameter is defined, let us have a look how to
publish it. First, some initialization is necessary. Let us assume
that missedLunch is an object of class MissedLunches, and a member
variable of YourPublisher.

<P>
<PRE>
void YourPublisher::initialize(int stage) {
    BasicModule::initialize(stage);
    if(stage == 0) {
        // initialize it
        missedLunch.setCounter(0);
        // get the category
        missedLunchCat = bb-&gt;getCategory(&amp;missedLunch);
    }
    else if(stage == 1) {
        bb-&gt;publishBBItem(missedLunchCat, \
          &amp;missedLunch, parentModule()-&gt;id());
    }
}
</PRE>

<P>
You should initialize missedLunches properly. The next step is to
figure the category out, or put differently establish the connection
between a category integer and a class. Now you are all set to publish
it. We recommend that you publish your data in stage 1, this allows
all subscribers to initialize the copies they might have. Publishing
is a simple call to <code>bb-&gt;publishBBItem</code> . The first parameter is
the category, the second a pointer to the published object that
carries all the information that you want to publish, and the third is
the scope. <code>parentModule()-&gt;id()</code> may not be useful as a scope
in your case. There is no default or wildcard - you have to think
about a reasonable and easy to understand scope.

<P>
Actually, we already covered how to publish a change when the
simulation runs. Let us assume that YourPublisher tracks missed
lunches somehow:

<P>
<PRE>
void YourPublisher::handleMissedLunch() {
       // update information 
       missedLunch.addMissedLunch();
       // publish it.
       bb-&gt;publishBBItem(missedLunchCat, \
          &amp;missedLunch, parentModule()-&gt;id());
}
</PRE>

<P>
YourPublisher simply has to update the information, and call the
publish function again. That's it.
