This directory provides a template for your own simulation. Copy it
into a directory of your choice and start changing the
files.

You should then delete those files were one of the modules provided in
the framework suffices (i.e. those files you did not touch) -- this is 
a good moment to have a look at the documentation prepared for you in 
the doc subdirectory of the MF. 

Rename the remaining files into something useful (do not forget to
update your .ned files and the include directives) and start entering
your code at the places marked with

// ENTER YOUR CODE HERE

Edit the Makefile.gen (or the Makefile.gen.vc respectively) to tell it 
where the MF resides. 

Linux / MAC OS:
 Call
 $ make -f Makefile.gen
 and then 
 $ make 

Windows:
 Call
 $ nmake /nologo /f Makefile.gen.vc
 and then
 $ nmake /nologo /f Makefile.vc

Congratulations -- your simulation useing the MF is ready for 
execution.
