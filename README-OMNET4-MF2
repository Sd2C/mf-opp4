This directory contains a port of Mobility Framework 2.0p3
to the Omnet++ 4.0 simulator.

All of "core" was ported, as well as "contrib".

All was not tested though, and the "networks" and "testSuite" directories
have not been ported.

Changes
-------
In contrib, the P2PLayer does not use the sendDirect method anymore.
The core/include and contrib/include directories have been removed, as well as
the core/lib and contrib/lib directories, to simplify the build process.
The libraries are now in core/libmfcore.so and in contrib/libmfcontrib.so.

How to use
----------
Edit the "env.sh" file. You only need to set the path to your installation
of omnet++ 4. After that, use "source env.sh" to import these variables into your shell.

Please proceed as follows to build from a shell:
make core
make contrib

After starting the omnet IDE, you can import the project by right-clicking
in the project list and use the "Import..." wizard, and 
"General->Existing project into Workspace". 
Select the directory containing the branch as root directory.
