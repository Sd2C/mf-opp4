How to use
==========
(1) Generate the Makefile: edit makemakefiles, execution of mkmk.
    Edit the Makefile to select USERIF_LIBS=$(CMDENV_LIBS)

(2) Edit generate_scenarios.m

Choose the number of nodes to consider, grid length and
margins. The sink will be at the extreme left of the line,
at a distance marginX of the grid border.

(3) Execute generate_scenarios.m
will create omnetpp_positions.ini, omnetpp_routes.ini,
omnetpp_runs.ini, positions.mat (which can be loaded back
into matlab) and runall.sh.

(4) Execute runall.sh
will execute all simulations runs.

(5) Clean up data with ./cleanupall.sh
will edit omnetpp.sca and only keep numerical data.
Output is saved in scalars.clean

(6) Load data from scalars.clean in matlab or octave and plot the simulation results compared to a theoretical curve. The plotresults script requires set_params and ber from the trunk/matlab/topology/lib folder. set_params contains the radio model and ber contains the ber computation formula.
